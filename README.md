# PersonalRLBot
A work-in-progress bot for Rocket League using RLBot

The Framework for this bot is not my own. For the set-up and 
introduction please go look at https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot.

The implementation of the bot (e.g. strategy and movements) is the interesting part of this.
runner.py is the python script that runs the bot.
